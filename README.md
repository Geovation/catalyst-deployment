# Catalyst

Catalyst is a set of tools created to make it easier to deploy infrastructure that uses Ordnance Survey data

We know from working with the Geovation community how frantic early months of development time can be, these tools are designed to take some of the burden away by automically deploying resources in the best way and shorttening the time it takes you to start creating value with Ordnance Survey Data
